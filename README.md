\item KNIME: contains KNIME pipeline and associated user manual for software setup and running instructions and tips. Expected installation and set-up time for all dependencies is approximately 2 hours.  The KNIME pipeline was tested on a machine running Windows 10, with 64GB RAM and an Intel Core i7-7740X CPU @ 4.30GHz processor. Expected runtime of the sample data on a machine with similar CPU specifications is approximately 4 hours for all components of the pipeline. Most users will typically only run either the user-defined or data-driven sections, not both.

\item SampleData: contains expected output, and information on the settings used to generate it. Sample data can be accessed at ___.
